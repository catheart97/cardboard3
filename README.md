# Carboard3

Carboard3 uses OpenGL 3 ES on mobile phones and OpenGL 3 Core on desktop devices for rendering. 


## Build

The test build were done with:

* Qt 5.15.0 MSVC2019 with LLVM Clang Compiler 10.0.0 (x64)
* Qt 5.15.0 armeabi-v7a Android with Android-Clang, NDK Version: 21.3.6528147, Java 1.8.0 Oracle JDK

Lower Versions of Qt and the Visual Studio Compiler might work as well. Make sure the used compiler does support C++17.
